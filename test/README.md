# Project Start Guide

> Make sure to run the command that will install the dependencies

```sh
$ npm install
```
### Make sure you are running the project before you start the test.

Now we can start the `test` with the following command
```sh
$ npm run week1
```
For `week2` and so on...
```sh
$ npm run week2
```

You should see which test pass or fail.
> Note that is a test is stuck it will timeout, there is no need to try to shutdown the `test`
